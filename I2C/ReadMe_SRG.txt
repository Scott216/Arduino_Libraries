This library is by Wayne Truchsess at DSS Circuits.
See article:
http://dsscircuits.com/index.php/articles/66-arduino-i2c-master-library

Wayne wrote this library to replace wire.h as the I2C Master.  You still need wire.h as 
the Slave I2C.  This library uses less memory, has a timeout() feature, and supports repeated starts for devices that require this.
