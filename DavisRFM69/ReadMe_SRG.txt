Notes from Scott:

RFM69registers.h comes from
https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/blob/2d233df459d404583243d0ceb3c7881f8bb43f3f/RFM69registers.h

The above is not the latest version of RFM69registers.h, some needed registers were removed in this update http://bit.ly/1BRNKTE

DavisRFM69 files are from:
https://github.com/dekay/DavisRFM69

I made some changes to DavisRFM69.h/.cpp files so it would be compatible with the MoteinoMega.
